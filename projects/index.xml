This has included research, writing, and artworks, an online curriculum, interview series, numerous on-and-offline events, lectures, performances, and the development of assisted listening and composition tools, including an instrument.
Back in 2018, Joel and James commissioned an artwork for an exhibition they were planning called Eavesdropping and I ended up producing an installation, Always Learning and a video, Learning from YouTube.</description></item></channel></rss>
