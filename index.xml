It has played host to a few different digital experiments, a zine, one of the first sites of the AAARG library, and some attempts at real-time archiving of my own writing and artwork. Through that time, the web centralized into an uneasy ecosystem of a few social media platforms and an unknown number of more or less established traditional media (journalism, essays, etc.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://somethingilearned.today/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://somethingilearned.today/about/</guid><description>bio #Artist and writer Sean Dockray is a Senior Lecturer in Fine Art at Naarm&amp;rsquo;s Monash University, and his work investigates the politics of technology, focusing on artificial intelligences and the algorithmic web.

This has included research, writing, and artworks, an online curriculum, interview series, numerous on-and-offline events, lectures, performances, and the development of assisted listening and composition tools, including an instrument.
Back in 2018, Joel and James commissioned an artwork for an exhibition they were planning called Eavesdropping and I ended up producing an installation, Always Learning and a video, Learning from YouTube.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://somethingilearned.today/writing/overview/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://somethingilearned.today/writing/overview/</guid><description> ‘All possible sounds’: speech, music, and the emergence of machine listening
2023, James Parker with Sean Dockray
An article that situates machine listening within a wider field that includes speech processing and music analysis and synthesis, pointing to its voracious tendency to understand &amp;ldquo;all possible sounds.&amp;rdquo; It begins with a discussion of Learning from YouTube.

“Machine listening” is one common term for a fast-growing interdisciplinary field of science and engineering that “uses signal processing and machine learning to extract useful information from sound”. This article contributes to the critical literature on machine listening by presenting some of its history as a field.</description></item></channel></rss>
