more than 20 years. It has played host to a few different digital experiments, a zine, one of the first sites of the AAARG library, and some attempts at real-time archiving of my own writing and artwork. Through that time, the web centralized into an uneasy ecosystem of a few social media platforms and an unknown number of more or less established traditional media (journalism, essays, etc.) outlets publishing online.</p><p><strong>e-rat</strong> was my first domain and I liked it at the time because it poked fun at the way we hyped the modernizing shift from offline to online by slapping an <strong>e-</strong> in front of it (like <em>e-commerce</em>). Electronicified rats sounded perverse, maybe inspiring. Rats thrive in urbanized capitalism, so how do they find their way in the slick, clean, immateriality of the web? It prompts questions about waste and breakdown and how material these things really are. Over time the &ldquo;e-&rdquo; became dated. Apple began to shift the focus of attention from the network to the consumer and their personal preferences: <em>iDevices</em>.</p><p>If you work in cultural production, you may have also noticed that alongside this shift to the self and the centralization of the web, a trend of self-archiving and self-promoting vanity domains has emerged largely since 2014: <strong>yourname.com</strong>. In many ways this reminded me of something <a href=http://basekamp.com/ target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Scott Rigby</a> said about the banality of using a website to document your own accomplishments when they could be creating new communities and platforms and tools to change the way we do things. It stuck with me and I always felt a little ashamed when I felt myself engaging in a little <strong>seandockray.com</strong>. That might be part of the reason that for the past few years my homepage has consisted in nothing but this image of Michel Siffrè, trying to learn his own internal time clock in the depths of a Texas cave, passing time, reading Plato.</p><p><figure><img class="mx-auto my-0 rounded-md" src=/blog/rip-e-rat/michel-siffre.jpeg alt=blog/rip-e-rat/michel-siffre.jpeg loading=lazy></figure></p></div></section><footer class="pt-8 max-w-prose print:hidden"></footer></article><div class="pointer-events-none absolute bottom-0 end-0 top-[100vh] w-12"><a href=#the-top class="pointer-events-auto sticky top-[calc(100vh-5.5rem)] flex h-12 w-12 items-center justify-center rounded-full bg-neutral/50 text-xl text-neutral-700 backdrop-blur hover:text-primary-600 dark:bg-neutral-800/50 dark:text-neutral dark:hover:text-primary-400" aria-label="Scroll to top" title="Scroll to top">&uarr;</a></div></main><footer class="py-10 print:hidden"><div class="flex items-center justify-between"><div><p class="text-xs text-neutral-500 dark:text-neutral-400">Powered by <a class="hover:underline hover:decoration-primary-400 hover:text-primary-500" href=https://gohugo.io/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Hugo</a> & <a class="hover:underline hover:decoration-primary-400 hover:text-primary-500" href=https://git.io/hugo-congo target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Congo</a></p></div></div><p class="text-xs text-neutral-500 dark:text-neutral-400">and <a href=https://obsidian.md>Obsidian</a></p></footer></div></body></html>
